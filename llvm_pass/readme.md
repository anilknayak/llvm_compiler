# LLVM Pass
This is very interesting topic. I like this very much. 
This LLVM passes are used to oprtimize the C and CPP code and regenerate code for the deployment.

## LLVM Pass modules
1. Function Pass
2. Mutable Function Pass

## llmv_pass dirs has all the pass tutorials
### Build All llvm pass modules
1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. cd ..

After this you have build the *.so libraries for all the pass modules.
For invocation of LLVM pass go to each pass example directory for more information
